In this work we evaluate whether F. hepatica glycans can immune modulate DCs via DC-SIGN. We demonstrate that DC-SIGN interacts with F. hepatica glycoconjugates through mannose and fucose residues. We also show that mannose is present in high-mannose structures, hybrid and trimannosyl N-glycans with terminal GlcNAc. Furthermore, we demonstrate that F. hepatica glycans induce DC-SIGN triggering leading to a strong production of TLR-induced IL-10 and IL-27p28. In addition, parasite glycans induced regulatory DCs via DC-SIGN that decrease allogeneic T cell proliferation, via the induction of anergic/regulatory T cells, highlighting the role of DC-SIGN in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses by F. hepatica. Our data confirm the immunomodulatory properties of DC-SIGN triggered by pathogen-derived glycans and contribute to the identification of immunomodulatory glyans of helminths that might eventually be useful for the design of vaccines against fasciolosis.\n",

However, there is no direct structural information that helps to delineate the mechanisms by which S-crystallin could have evolved. Here we report the structural and biochemical characterization of novel S-crystallin-glutathione complex. The 2.35-Å crystal structure of a S-crystallin mutant from Octopus vulgaris reveals an active-site architecture that is different from that of GST. S-crystallin has a preference for glutathione binding, although almost lost its GST enzymatic activity. We've also identified four historical mutations that are able to produce a \"GST-like\" S-crystallin that has regained activity. This protein recapitulates the evolution of S-crystallin from GST. Protein stability studies suggest that S-crystallin is stabilized by glutathione binding to prevent its aggregation; this contrasts with GST-σ, which do not possess this protection. We suggest that a tradeoff between enzyme activity and the stability of the lens protein might have been one of the major driving force behind lens evolution.\n",

However, several viruses encode tetherin antagonists and it is at present unknown whether residual VSV spread in tetherin-positive cells is also promoted by a virus-encoded tetherin antagonist. Here, we show that the viral glycoprotein (VSV-G) antagonizes tetherin in transfected cells, although with reduced efficiency as compared to the HIV-1 Vpu protein. Tetherin antagonism did not involve alteration of tetherin expression and was partially dependent on a GXXXG motif in the transmembrane domain of VSV-G. However, mutation of the GXXXG motif did not modulate tetherin sensitivity of infectious VSV. These results identify VSV-G as a tetherin antagonist in transfected cells but fail to provide evidence for a contribution of tetherin antagonism to viral spread.

       "4    (n = 83) and medical staff (n = 12) had to undergo dialysis treatment in an isolated environment. This study was performed to investigate the effects of stress caused by dialysis treatment under isolation. Plasma samples from the HD patients and medical staff were collected at the time of isolation(M0), the following month(M1), and three months after isolation(M3). Parameters for stress included circulating cell-free genomic DNA(ccf-gDNA), circulating cell-free mitochondria DNA(ccf-mtDNA), and pentraxin-3(PTX-3). Decreased values of Hct, kt/v and ca x p were recovered after the end of two weeks of isolation. The levels of ccf-gDNA and ccf-mtDNA were the highest at M0 and decreased gradually in both HD patients and the medical staff. The normalization of ccf-gDNA and ccf-mtDNA was significantly delayed in HD patients compared with the response in the medical staff. PTX-3 increased only in HD patients and was highest at M0, and it then gradually decreased. Medical isolation and subnormal quality of care during the MERS outbreak caused extreme stress in HD patients. Plasma cell-free DNA and PTX-3 seems to be good indicators of stress and quality of care in HD patients. Measurement of plasma cell-free genomic DNA and cell-free mitochondria DNA. Circulating cf-DNA was extracted from 200 μL of plasma using a QIAamp DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). The ccf-gDNA and ccf-mtDNA were amplified using a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Massachusetts). Primers for the human NADH1 dehydrogenase 1 gene (ND1) were used for mtDNA, and primers for the human lipoprotein lipase gene (LPL) were used for gDNA. Standard DNA fragments of ND1 and LPL were synthesized using an Integrated DNA Technologies kit (IDT, Coralville, IA) for absolute quantification. The fragment solutions were 10-fold serially diluted. The concentrations of DNA were converted to copy number using the Andrew Staroscik Calculator for the absolute copy number from a template 33 . All samples were analyzed in duplicate, and a no-template negative control was included in every analysis.\n",

In this work we evaluate whether F. hepatica glycans can immune modulate DCs via DC-SIGN. We demonstrate that DC-SIGN interacts with F. hepatica glycoconjugates through mannose and fucose residues. We also show that mannose is present in high-mannose structures, hybrid and trimannosyl N-glycans with terminal GlcNAc. Furthermore, we demonstrate that F. hepatica glycans induce DC-SIGN triggering leading to a strong production of TLR-induced IL-10 and IL-27p28. In addition, parasite glycans induced regulatory DCs via DC-SIGN that decrease allogeneic T cell proliferation, via the induction of anergic/regulatory T cells, highlighting the role of DC-SIGN in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses by F. hepatica. Our data confirm the immunomodulatory properties of DC-SIGN triggered by pathogen-derived glycans and contribute to the identification of immunomodulatory glyans of helminths that might eventually be useful for the design of vaccines against fasciolosis.</td>\n",

However, there is no direct structural information that helps to delineate the mechanisms by which S-crystallin could have evolved. Here we report the structural and biochemical characterization of novel S-crystallin-glutathione complex. The 2.35-Å crystal structure of a S-crystallin mutant from Octopus vulgaris reveals an active-site architecture that is different from that of GST. S-crystallin has a preference for glutathione binding, although almost lost its GST enzymatic activity. We've also identified four historical mutations that are able to produce a \"GST-like\" S-crystallin that has regained activity. This protein recapitulates the evolution of S-crystallin from GST. Protein stability studies suggest that S-crystallin is stabilized by glutathione binding to prevent its aggregation; this contrasts with GST-σ, which do not possess this protection. We suggest that a tradeoff between enzyme activity and the stability of the lens protein might have been one of the major driving force behind lens evolution.</td>\n",

However, several viruses encode tetherin antagonists and it is at present unknown whether residual VSV spread in tetherin-positive cells is also promoted by a virus-encoded tetherin antagonist. Here, we show that the viral glycoprotein (VSV-G) antagonizes tetherin in transfected cells, although with reduced efficiency as compared to the HIV-1 Vpu protein. Tetherin antagonism did not involve alteration of tetherin expression and was partially dependent on a GXXXG motif in the transmembrane domain of VSV-G. However, mutation of the GXXXG motif did not modulate tetherin sensitivity of infectious VSV. These results identify VSV-G as a tetherin antagonist in transfected cells but fail to provide evidence for a contribution of tetherin antagonism to viral spread.

       "      <td>(n = 83) and medical staff (n = 12) had to undergo dialysis treatment in an isolated environment. This study was performed to investigate the effects of stress caused by dialysis treatment under isolation. Plasma samples from the HD patients and medical staff were collected at the time of isolation(M0), the following month(M1), and three months after isolation(M3). Parameters for stress included circulating cell-free genomic DNA(ccf-gDNA), circulating cell-free mitochondria DNA(ccf-mtDNA), and pentraxin-3(PTX-3). Decreased values of Hct, kt/v and ca x p were recovered after the end of two weeks of isolation. The levels of ccf-gDNA and ccf-mtDNA were the highest at M0 and decreased gradually in both HD patients and the medical staff. The normalization of ccf-gDNA and ccf-mtDNA was significantly delayed in HD patients compared with the response in the medical staff. PTX-3 increased only in HD patients and was highest at M0, and it then gradually decreased. Medical isolation and subnormal quality of care during the MERS outbreak caused extreme stress in HD patients. Plasma cell-free DNA and PTX-3 seems to be good indicators of stress and quality of care in HD patients. Measurement of plasma cell-free genomic DNA and cell-free mitochondria DNA. Circulating cf-DNA was extracted from 200 μL of plasma using a QIAamp DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). The ccf-gDNA and ccf-mtDNA were amplified using a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Massachusetts). Primers for the human NADH1 dehydrogenase 1 gene (ND1) were used for mtDNA, and primers for the human lipoprotein lipase gene (LPL) were used for gDNA. Standard DNA fragments of ND1 and LPL were synthesized using an Integrated DNA Technologies kit (IDT, Coralville, IA) for absolute quantification. The fragment solutions were 10-fold serially diluted. The concentrations of DNA were converted to copy number using the Andrew Staroscik Calculator for the absolute copy number from a template 33 . All samples were analyzed in duplicate, and a no-template negative control was included in every analysis.</td>\n",

This is the first report on a replicating, infectious gammaherpesvirus from bats. The new virus is named bat gammaherpesvirus 8 (BGHV8), also known as Myotis gammaherpesvirus 8, and is able to infect multiple cell lines, including those of human origin. Using nextgeneration sequencing technology, the authors constructed a full-length annotated genomic map of BGHV8.

       "      <td>Zoonotic infectious diseases have been an important concern to humankind for more than 10,000 years. Today, approximately 75% of newly emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are zoonoses that result from various anthropogenic, genetic, ecologic, socioeconomic, and climatic factors. These interrelated driving forces make it difficult to predict and to prevent zoonotic EIDs. Although significant improvements in environmental and medical surveillance, clinical diagnostic methods, and medical practices have been achieved in the recent years, zoonotic EIDs remain a major global concern, and such threats are expanding, especially in less developed regions. The current Ebola epidemic in West Africa is an extreme stark reminder of the role animal reservoirs play in public health and reinforces the urgent need for globally operationalizing a One Health approach. The complex nature of zoonotic diseases and the limited resources in developing countries are a reminder that the need for implementation of Global One Health in lowresource settings is crucial. The Veterinary Public Health and Biotechnology (VPH-Biotec) Global Consortium launched the International Congress on Pathogens at the Human-Animal Interface (ICOPHAI) in order to address important challenges and needs for capacity building. The inaugural ICOPHAI (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2011) and the second congress (Porto de Galinhas, Brazil, 2013) were unique opportunities to share and discuss issues related to zoonotic infectious diseases worldwide. In addition to strong scientific reports in eight thematic areas that necessitate One Health implementation, the congress identified four key capacity-building needs: (1) development of adequate science-based risk management policies, (2) skilled-personnel capacity building, (3) accredited veterinary and public health diagnostic laboratories with a shared database, and (4) improved use of existing natural resources and implementation. The aim of this review is to highlight advances in key zoonotic disease areas and the One Health capacity needs.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Zoonotic viruses circulate as swarms in animal reservoirs and can emerge into human populations, causing epidemics that adversely affect public health. Portable, safe, and effective vaccine platforms are needed in the context of these outbreak and emergence situations. In this work, we report the generation and characterization of an alphavirus replicon vaccine platform based on a non-select agent, attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus vaccine, strain 3526 (VRP 3526). Using both noroviruses and coronaviruses as model systems, we demonstrate the utility of the VRP 3526 platform in the generation of recombinant proteins, production of virus-like particles, and in vivo efficacy as a vaccine against emergent viruses. Importantly, packaging under biosafety level 2 (BSL2) conditions distinguishes VRP 3526 from previously reported alphavirus platforms and makes this approach accessible to the majority of laboratories around the world. In addition, improved outcomes in the vulnerable aged models as well as against heterologous challenge suggest improved efficacy compared to that of previously attenuated VRP approaches. Taking these results together, the VRP 3526 platform represents a safe and highly portable system that can be rapidly deployed under BSL2 conditions for generation of candidate vaccines against emerging microbial pathogens. IMPORTANCE While VEE virus replicon particles provide a robust, established platform for antigen expression and vaccination, its utility has been limited by the requirement for high-containment-level facilities for production and packaging. In this work, we utilize an attenuated vaccine strain capable of use at lower biocontainment level but retaining the capacity of the wild-type replicon particle. Importantly, the new replicon platform provides equal protection for aged mice and following heterologous challenge, which distinguishes it from other attenuated replicon platforms. Together, the new system represents a highly portable, safe system for use in the context of disease emergence.</td>\n",

However, there is no direct structural information that helps to delineate the mechanisms by which S-crystallin could have evolved. Here we report the structural and biochemical characterization of novel S-crystallin-glutathione complex. The 2.35-Å crystal structure of a S-crystallin mutant from Octopus vulgaris reveals an active-site architecture that is different from that of GST. S-crystallin has a preference for glutathione binding, although almost lost its GST enzymatic activity. We've also identified four historical mutations that are able to produce a \"GST-like\" S-crystallin that has regained activity. This protein recapitulates the evolution of S-crystallin from GST. Protein stability studies suggest that S-crystallin is stabilized by glutathione binding to prevent its aggregation; this contrasts with GST-σ, which do not possess this protection. We suggest that a tradeoff between enzyme activity and the stability of the lens protein might have been one of the major driving force behind lens evolution.\n",

However, several viruses encode tetherin antagonists and it is at present unknown whether residual VSV spread in tetherin-positive cells is also promoted by a virus-encoded tetherin antagonist. Here, we show that the viral glycoprotein (VSV-G) antagonizes tetherin in transfected cells, although with reduced efficiency as compared to the HIV-1 Vpu protein. Tetherin antagonism did not involve alteration of tetherin expression and was partially dependent on a GXXXG motif in the transmembrane domain of VSV-G. However, mutation of the GXXXG motif did not modulate tetherin sensitivity of infectious VSV. These results identify VSV-G as a tetherin antagonist in transfected cells but fail to provide evidence for a contribution of tetherin antagonism to viral spread.

       "4      (n = 83) and medical staff (n = 12) had to undergo dialysis treatment in an isolated environment. This study was performed to investigate the effects of stress caused by dialysis treatment under isolation. Plasma samples from the HD patients and medical staff were collected at the time of isolation(M0), the following month(M1), and three months after isolation(M3). Parameters for stress included circulating cell-free genomic DNA(ccf-gDNA), circulating cell-free mitochondria DNA(ccf-mtDNA), and pentraxin-3(PTX-3). Decreased values of Hct, kt/v and ca x p were recovered after the end of two weeks of isolation. The levels of ccf-gDNA and ccf-mtDNA were the highest at M0 and decreased gradually in both HD patients and the medical staff. The normalization of ccf-gDNA and ccf-mtDNA was significantly delayed in HD patients compared with the response in the medical staff. PTX-3 increased only in HD patients and was highest at M0, and it then gradually decreased. Medical isolation and subnormal quality of care during the MERS outbreak caused extreme stress in HD patients. Plasma cell-free DNA and PTX-3 seems to be good indicators of stress and quality of care in HD patients. Measurement of plasma cell-free genomic DNA and cell-free mitochondria DNA. Circulating cf-DNA was extracted from 200 μL of plasma using a QIAamp DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). The ccf-gDNA and ccf-mtDNA were amplified using a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Massachusetts). Primers for the human NADH1 dehydrogenase 1 gene (ND1) were used for mtDNA, and primers for the human lipoprotein lipase gene (LPL) were used for gDNA. Standard DNA fragments of ND1 and LPL were synthesized using an Integrated DNA Technologies kit (IDT, Coralville, IA) for absolute quantification. The fragment solutions were 10-fold serially diluted. The concentrations of DNA were converted to copy number using the Andrew Staroscik Calculator for the absolute copy number from a template 33 .

In a recent article, R. S. Shabman et al. (mSphere 1[1]:e00070-15, 2016, 10.1128 report the identification of a novel gammaherpesvirus in a cell line derived from the microbat Myotis velifer incautus. This is the first report on a replicating, infectious gammaherpesvirus from bats. The new virus is named bat gammaherpesvirus 8 (BGHV8), also known as Myotis gammaherpesvirus 8, and is able to infect multiple cell lines, including those of human origin. Using nextgeneration sequencing technology, the authors constructed a full-length annotated genomic map of BGHV8. Phylogenetic analysis of several genes from BGHV8 revealed similarity to several mammalian gammaherpesviruses, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).

       "10579                                              Zoonotic infectious diseases have been an important concern to humankind for more than 10,000 years. Today, approximately 75% of newly emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are zoonoses that result from various anthropogenic, genetic, ecologic, socioeconomic, and climatic factors. These interrelated driving forces make it difficult to predict and to prevent zoonotic EIDs. Although significant improvements in environmental and medical surveillance, clinical diagnostic methods, and medical practices have been achieved in the recent years, zoonotic EIDs remain a major global concern, and such threats are expanding, especially in less developed regions. The current Ebola epidemic in West Africa is an extreme stark reminder of the role animal reservoirs play in public health and reinforces the urgent need for globally operationalizing a One Health approach. The complex nature of zoonotic diseases and the limited resources in developing countries are a reminder that the need for implementation of Global One Health in lowresource settings is crucial. The Veterinary Public Health and Biotechnology (VPH-Biotec) Global Consortium launched the International Congress on Pathogens at the Human-Animal Interface (ICOPHAI) in order to address important challenges and needs for capacity building. The inaugural ICOPHAI (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2011) and the second congress (Porto de Galinhas, Brazil, 2013) were unique opportunities to share and discuss issues related to zoonotic infectious diseases worldwide. In addition to strong scientific reports in eight thematic areas that necessitate One Health implementation, the congress identified four key capacity-building needs: (1) development of adequate science-based risk management policies, (2) skilled-personnel capacity building, (3) accredited veterinary and public health diagnostic laboratories with a shared database, and (4) improved use of existing natural resources and implementation. The aim of this review is to highlight advances in key zoonotic disease areas and the One Health capacity needs.\n",
       "10580                                              Zoonotic viruses circulate as swarms in animal reservoirs and can emerge into human populations, causing epidemics that adversely affect public health. Portable, safe, and effective vaccine platforms are needed in the context of these outbreak and emergence situations. In this work, we report the generation and characterization of an alphavirus replicon vaccine platform based on a non-select agent, attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus vaccine, strain 3526 (VRP 3526). Using both noroviruses and coronaviruses as model systems, we demonstrate the utility of the VRP 3526 platform in the generation of recombinant proteins, production of virus-like particles, and in vivo efficacy as a vaccine against emergent viruses. Importantly, packaging under biosafety level 2 (BSL2) conditions distinguishes VRP 3526 from previously reported alphavirus platforms and makes this approach accessible to the majority of laboratories around the world. In addition, improved outcomes in the vulnerable aged models as well as against heterologous challenge suggest improved efficacy compared to that of previously attenuated VRP approaches. Taking these results together, the VRP 3526 platform represents a safe and highly portable system that can be rapidly deployed under BSL2 conditions for generation of candidate vaccines against emerging microbial pathogens. IMPORTANCE While VEE virus replicon particles provide a robust, established platform for antigen expression and vaccination, its utility has been limited by the requirement for high-containment-level facilities for production and packaging. In this work, we utilize an attenuated vaccine strain capable of use at lower biocontainment level but retaining the capacity of the wild-type replicon particle. Importantly, the new replicon platform provides equal protection for aged mice and following heterologous challenge, which distinguishes it from other attenuated replicon platforms. Together, the new system represents a highly portable, safe system for use in the context of disease emergence.\n",

       "4        (n = 83) and medical staff (n = 12) had to undergo dialysis treatment in an isolated environment. this study was performed to investigate the effects of stress caused by dialysis treatment under isolation. plasma samples from the hd patients and medical staff were collected at the time of isolation(m0), the following month(m1), and three months after isolation(m3). parameters for stress included circulating cell-free genomic dna(ccf-gdna), circulating cell-free mitochondria dna(ccf-mtdna), and pentraxin-3(ptx-3). decreased values of hct, kt/v and ca x p were recovered after the end of two weeks of isolation. the levels of ccf-gdna and ccf-mtdna were the highest at m0 and decreased gradually in both hd patients and the medical staff. the normalization of ccf-gdna and ccf-mtdna was significantly delayed in hd patients compared with the response in the medical staff. ptx-3 increased only in hd patients and was highest at m0, and it then gradually decreased. medical isolation and subnormal quality of care during the mers outbreak caused extreme stress in hd patients. plasma cell-free dna and ptx-3 seems to be good indicators of stress and quality of care in hd patients. measurement of plasma cell-free genomic dna and cell-free mitochondria dna. circulating cf-dna was extracted from 200 μl of plasma using a qiaamp dneasy blood and tissue kit (qiagen, valencia, calif). the ccf-gdna and ccf-mtdna were amplified using a steponeplus real-time pcr system (applied biosystems, massachusetts). primers for the human nadh1 dehydrogenase 1 gene (nd1) were used for mtdna, and primers for the human lipoprotein lipase gene (lpl) were used for gdna. standard dna fragments of nd1 and lpl were synthesized using an integrated dna technologies kit (idt, coralville, ia) for absolute quantification. the fragment solutions were 10-fold serially diluted. the concentrations of dna were converted to copy number using the andrew staroscik calculator for the absolute copy number from a template 33 . all samples were analyzed in duplicate, and a no-template negative control was included in every analysis.\n",

       "10580                                                zoonotic viruses circulate as swarms in animal reservoirs and can emerge into human populations, causing epidemics that adversely affect public health. portable, safe, and effective vaccine platforms are needed in the context of these outbreak and emergence situations. in this work, we report the generation and characterization of an alphavirus replicon vaccine platform based on a non-select agent, attenuated venezuelan equine encephalitis (vee) virus vaccine, strain 3526 (vrp 3526). using both noroviruses and coronaviruses as model systems, we demonstrate the utility of the vrp 3526 platform in the generation of recombinant proteins, production of virus-like particles, and in vivo efficacy as a vaccine against emergent viruses. importantly, packaging under biosafety level 2 (bsl2) conditions distinguishes vrp 3526 from previously reported alphavirus platforms and makes this approach accessible to the majority of laboratories around the world. in addition, improved outcomes in the vulnerable aged models as well as against heterologous challenge suggest improved efficacy compared to that of previously attenuated vrp approaches. taking these results together, the vrp 3526 platform represents a safe and highly portable system that can be rapidly deployed under bsl2 conditions for generation of candidate vaccines against emerging microbial pathogens. importance while vee virus replicon particles provide a robust, established platform for antigen expression and vaccination, its utility has been limited by the requirement for high-containment-level facilities for production and packaging. in this work, we utilize an attenuated vaccine strain capable of use at lower biocontainment level but retaining the capacity of the wild-type replicon particle. importantly, the new replicon platform provides equal protection for aged mice and following heterologous challenge, which distinguishes it from other attenuated replicon platforms. together, the new system represents a highly portable, safe system for use in the context of disease emergence.\n",

       "4  (n = 83) and medical staff (n = 12) had to undergo dialysis treatment in an isolated environment. this study was performed to investigate the effects of stress caused by dialysis treatment under isolation. plasma samples from the hd patients and medical staff were collected at the time of isolation(m0), the following month(m1), and three months after isolation(m3). parameters for stress included circulating cell-free genomic dna(ccf-gdna), circulating cell-free mitochondria dna(ccf-mtdna), and pentraxin-3(ptx-3). decreased values of hct, kt/v and ca x p were recovered after the end of two weeks of isolation. the levels of ccf-gdna and ccf-mtdna were the highest at m0 and decreased gradually in both hd patients and the medical staff. the normalization of ccf-gdna and ccf-mtdna was significantly delayed in hd patients compared with the response in the medical staff. ptx-3 increased only in hd patients and was highest at m0, and it then gradually decreased. medical isolation and subnormal quality of care during the mers outbreak caused extreme stress in hd patients. plasma cell-free dna and ptx-3 seems to be good indicators of stress and quality of care in hd patients. measurement of plasma cell-free genomic dna and cell-free mitochondria dna. circulating cf-dna was extracted from 200 μl of plasma using a qiaamp dneasy blood and tissue kit (qiagen, valencia, calif). the ccf-gdna and ccf-mtdna were amplified using a steponeplus real-time pcr system (applied biosystems, massachusetts). primers for the human nadh1 dehydrogenase 1 gene (nd1) were used for mtdna, and primers for the human lipoprotein lipase gene (lpl) were used for gdna. standard dna fragments of nd1 and lpl were synthesized using an integrated dna technologies kit (idt, coralville, ia) for absolute quantification. the fragment solutions were 10-fold serially diluted. the concentrations of dna were converted to copy number using the andrew staroscik calculator for the absolute copy number from a template 33 . all samples were analyzed in duplicate, and a no-template negative control was included in every analysis.   \n",

       "      <td>zika virus (zikv), a member of the flaviviridae family, is the most recent emerging arbovirus with pandemic potential. during infection, viruses trigger the host cell stress response, leading to changes in rna translation and the assembly of large aggregates of stalled translation preinitiation complexes, termed stress granules (sgs). several reports demonstrate that flaviviruses modulate the assembly of stress granules (sg). as an emerging pathogen, little is known however about how zikv modulates the host cell stress response. in this work, we investigate how zikv modulates sg assembly. we demonstrate that zikv negatively impacts sg assembly under oxidative stress conditions induced by sodium arsenite (ars), a treatment that leads to the phosphorylation of eif2α. by contrast, no measurable difference in sg assembly was observed between mock and zikv-infected cells treated with sodium selenite (se) or pateamine a (pata), compounds that trigger eif2α-independent sg assembly. interestingly, zikv infection markedly impaired the phosphorylation of eif2α triggered in ars-treated infected cells, and the abrogation of sg assembly in zikv-infected cells is, at least in part, dependent on eif2α dephosphorylation. these data demonstrate that zikv elicits mechanisms to counteract host anti-viral stress responses to promote a cellular environment propitious for viral replication.</td>\n",

       "43     a 23-year-old healthy male volunteer took part in a clinical trial in which the volunteer took chloroquine chemoprophylaxis and received three intradermal doses at four-week intervals of aseptic, purified plasmodium falciparum sporozoites to induce protective immunity against malaria. fifty-nine days after the last administration of sporozoites and 32 days after the last dose of chloroquine the volunteer underwent controlled human malaria infection (chmi) by the bites of five p. falciparum-infected mosquitoes. eleven days post-chmi a thick blood smear was positive (6 p. falciparum/μl blood) and treatment was initiated with atovaquone/proguanil (malarone®). on the second day of treatment, day 12 post-chmi, troponin t, a marker for cardiac tissue damage, began to rise above normal, and reached a maximum of 1,115 ng/l (upper range of normal = 14 ng/l) on day 16 post-chmi. the volunteer had one~20 minute episode of retrosternal chest pain and heavy feeling in his left arm on day 14 post-chmi. ecg at the time revealed minor repolarization disturbances, and cardiac mri demonstrated focal areas of subepicardial and midwall delayed enhancement of the left ventricle with some oedema and hypokinesia. a diagnosis of myocarditis was made. troponin t levels were normal within 16 days and the volunteer recovered without clinical sequelae. follow-up cardiac mri at almost five months showed normal function of both ventricles and disappearance of oedema. delayed enhancement of subepicardial and midwall regions decreased, but was still present. with the exception of a throat swab that was positive for rhinovirus on day 14 post-chmi, no other tests for potential aetiologies of the myocarditis were positive. a number of possible aetiological factors may explain or have contributed to this case of myocarditis including, i) p. falciparum infection, ii) rhinovirus infection, iii) unidentified pathogens, iv) hyper-immunization (the volunteer received six travel vaccines between the last immunization and the chmi), v) atovaquone/proguanil treatment, or vi) a combination of these factors. definitive aetiology and pathophysiological mechanism for the myocarditis have not been established.   \n",

       "10580  zoonotic viruses circulate as swarms in animal reservoirs and can emerge into human populations, causing epidemics that adversely affect public health. portable, safe, and effective vaccine platforms are needed in the context of these outbreak and emergence situations. in this work, we report the generation and characterization of an alphavirus replicon vaccine platform based on a non-select agent, attenuated venezuelan equine encephalitis (vee) virus vaccine, strain 3526 (vrp 3526). using both noroviruses and coronaviruses as model systems, we demonstrate the utility of the vrp 3526 platform in the generation of recombinant proteins, production of virus-like particles, and in vivo efficacy as a vaccine against emergent viruses. importantly, packaging under biosafety level 2 (bsl2) conditions distinguishes vrp 3526 from previously reported alphavirus platforms and makes this approach accessible to the majority of laboratories around the world. in addition, improved outcomes in the vulnerable aged models as well as against heterologous challenge suggest improved efficacy compared to that of previously attenuated vrp approaches. taking these results together, the vrp 3526 platform represents a safe and highly portable system that can be rapidly deployed under bsl2 conditions for generation of candidate vaccines against emerging microbial pathogens. importance while vee virus replicon particles provide a robust, established platform for antigen expression and vaccination, its utility has been limited by the requirement for high-containment-level facilities for production and packaging. in this work, we utilize an attenuated vaccine strain capable of use at lower biocontainment level but retaining the capacity of the wild-type replicon particle. importantly, the new replicon platform provides equal protection for aged mice and following heterologous challenge, which distinguishes it from other attenuated replicon platforms. together, the new system represents a highly portable, safe system for use in the context of disease emergence.   \n",

       "106    a large number of human genes associated with viral infections contain single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), which represent a genetic variation caused by the change of a single nucleotide in the dna sequence. snps are located in coding or non-coding genomic regions and can affect gene expression or protein function by different mechanisms. furthermore, they have been linked to multiple human diseases, highlighting their medical relevance. therefore, the identification and analysis of this kind of polymorphisms in the human genome has gained high importance in the research community, and an increasing number of studies have been published during the last years. as a consequence of this exhaustive exploration, an association between the presence of some specific snps and the susceptibility or severity of many infectious diseases in some risk population groups has been found. in this review, we discuss the relevance of snps that are important to understand the pathology derived from influenza a virus (iav) infections in humans and the susceptibility of some individuals to suffer more severe symptoms. we also discuss the importance of snps for iav vaccine effectiveness. multiple mechanisms, although there are some differences between strains. for that genome plasticity, iav take advantage of multiple strategies, such as alternative splicing, frameshift mechanisms, and overlapping open reading frames (orfs) [7] [8] [9] . in addition, the coding capability of the viral genome is extended by encoding multifunctional proteins that act at different steps during virus infection. of synthetized vrnp, ensuring that the vrnps are available for packaging [24] . moreover, nep has also other functions during iav infection, contributing to viral budding and to regulate viral rna synthesis. ns1 is a multifunctional protein and a key viral factor that counteracts the host antiviral responses. ns1 has been shown to inhibit the production of interferon (ifn), the activity and expression of multiple interferon-induced genes (isg) and the processing and nuclear transport of host mrnas causing cellular shut-off [25, 26] . segment 3 of iav also encodes two proteins, the polymerase component pa and pa-x. pa is translated directly from the pa mrna, whereas pa-x is translated using a +1 frameshift mechanism from the same open reading frame (orf) [9] . synergistically with ns1, pa-x is also able to block the cellular antiviral responses by inhibiting host protein expression. moreover, the pa-x protein has been shown to modulate host inflammation, immune responses, apoptosis, and virus pathogenesis [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .   \n",

       "10580  zoonotic viruses circulate as swarms in animal reservoirs and can emerge into human populations, causing epidemics that adversely affect public health. portable, safe, and effective vaccine platforms are needed in the context of these outbreak and emergence situations. in this work, we report the generation and characterization of an alphavirus replicon vaccine platform based on a non-select agent, attenuated venezuelan equine encephalitis (vee) virus vaccine, strain 3526 (vrp 3526). using both noroviruses and coronaviruses as model systems, we demonstrate the utility of the vrp 3526 platform in the generation of recombinant proteins, production of virus-like particles, and in vivo efficacy as a vaccine against emergent viruses. importantly, packaging under biosafety level 2 (bsl2) conditions distinguishes vrp 3526 from previously reported alphavirus platforms and makes this approach accessible to the majority of laboratories around the world. in addition, improved outcomes in the vulnerable aged models as well as against heterologous challenge suggest improved efficacy compared to that of previously attenuated vrp approaches. taking these results together, the vrp 3526 platform represents a safe and highly portable system that can be rapidly deployed under bsl2 conditions for generation of candidate vaccines against emerging microbial pathogens. importance while vee virus replicon particles provide a robust, established platform for antigen expression and vaccination, its utility has been limited by the requirement for high-containment-level facilities for production and packaging. in this work, we utilize an attenuated vaccine strain capable of use at lower biocontainment level but retaining the capacity of the wild-type replicon particle. importantly, the new replicon platform provides equal protection for aged mice and following heterologous challenge, which distinguishes it from other attenuated replicon platforms. together, the new system represents a highly portable, safe system for use in the context of disease emergence.   \n",
